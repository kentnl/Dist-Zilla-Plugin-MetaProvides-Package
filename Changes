 [00 IMPORTANT CHANGES]
 - previous versions had no support for standardised ways of hiding various
   types of internal packages as identified in rt#74675.
 - this release attempts to remedy that problem but incurs significant
   changes to facilitate this, which may cause potential problems for
   existing code.
 - however, its deemed incredibly unlikely that you have a legitimate use
   for any of the problems that this release might raise.
 - If you use the "package # comment \n packagename" formatting, that
   package name will no longer be indexed ( was in previous versions )
 - If you prefix a token with _, that entire namespace will be ignored,
   e.g.: _Foo , Foo::_Bar , Foo::_Bar::Baz and Foo::Bar::_Baz are all
   ignored.
 - the namespaces 'main' and 'DB' will be arbitrarily ignored. Its deemed
   unlikely you have a legitimate use for trying to 'provide' those 2
   packages, and now, if you so happen to use them, they'll be helpfully
   ignored. ( Previously, people had to use meta_noindex to exclude that
   pesky DB entry )

 [Bugs]
 - rt#74675 Should hopefully be resolved by this release, thanks be to
   XDG/David Golden for reporting this bug and providing helpful advice on
   how to handle it, as well as his contributions to Module::Metadata which
   this code now uses.

 [Dependencies]
 - use Module::MetaData, MooseX::Types::Moose
 - upgrade MetaProvides
 - Remove Module::Extract::*

 [Dependencies::Stats]
 - Dependencies changed, see Changes.deps{,.all,.dev} for details
 - runtime: +3 ↑2 -4
 - test: +1

 [Internals]
 - Now uses  Module::Metadata for both package and version probing.
 - the namespaces 'main' and 'DB' will now be automatically ignored and not
   injected into the provides map for any reason.
 - namespaces masked with the standard 'package # comment \n packagename'
   style are now ignored.
 - namespaces with a leading underscore in any token ( ie: _Foo::Bar or
   Foo::_Bar ) are ignored.
 - Files are no longer required to be sloshed out into a tempdir in order
   to be scanned. ( Yielding a minor performance boost )
 - internal debugging is slightly more verbose

 [Packaging]
 - Retroactively fixing changelog because something blew it away last time.
 - Added a .perltidyrc

 [Tests]
 - Added a test for correct behaviour of "private" and "hidden" packages of
   various standard forms.

1.12060502 2012-02-04T03:50:41Z

 [Internals]
 - All namespaces declare $AUTHORITY
 - $VERSION moved out of BEGIN
 - enhanced debug logging

 [Packaging]

 - Move extra tests to xt/
 - git resource URL's moved to https://
 - x_authority set in metadata.

1.12060501 2011-04-08T13:49:06Z
 [BugFix]

   on earlier versions.

 [Dependencies::Stats]

 - test: ↑1

1.12060213 2011-04-06T01:20:11Z
 [Dependencies::Stats]
 - Dependencies changed, see Changes.deps{,.all,.dev} for details
 - develop: +3 -3

 [Internals]
 - Minor refactors to make Critic happy about the complexity.

 [Packaging]
 - Move to @Author::KENTNL
 - Tighten Critic.
 - Rework Changes for CPAN::Changes.

 [Tests]
 - added CPAN::Changes
 - removed Portabilty

1.12044908 2010-11-07T20:08:27Z
 - Stronger deps on MetaNoIndex
 - Moved t/ to corpus
 - Note: upstream deps moved meta_no_index to default to ON.
 - Minor bumped to match MetaProvides.
 - Contents is stashed in a File::Temp before handing it to
   Module::Extract::* for portability reasons ( I can't guarantee a passed
   file exists on disk, and ME needs them on disk to work )
 - Added some tests that mean something.

 [Dependencies]
 - Use File::Temp and a few other test tools
 - Use newer MetaProvides bases.

1.11044404 2010-11-02T16:58:53Z
 - Update dist info.
 - Integrated the new meta_noindex / _apply_meta_noindex behaviour added to
   the role.

1.11034304 2010-07-25T16:18:01Z
 - Improved documentation so people don't need to do so much link checking.
   ( This is pretty much an acknowledgement that this side package, which
   was largely just a side-effect of the one designated for MX::D, has
   attained so much unexpected use that it warrants being the primary
   reason to install this plugin =) )

 [Dependencies::Removed / runtime requires]
 - aliased

1.11034201 2010-07-24T13:38:32Z
 - History forks here from Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MetaProvides

1.10034117 2010-07-24T05:37:49Z
 - Dropped xt/author/kwalitee.t to avoid the needless dep. ( Kwalitee Test
   plugin doesn't have this issue )

1.10027802 2010-05-22T13:08:02Z
 - Replaced most of dist.ini with @KENTNL ( Yeilding more accurate t/
   depends )
 - Removed =inc::Dist style loopback in favour of the more reliable and
   more generic =inc::lib

1.10027518 2010-05-20T05:33:10Z
 - Upgraded tests to Dist::Zilla 2.x. ( should resolve rt #56482 ) ( Thanks
   to DAXIM/Lars Dɪᴇᴄᴋᴏᴡ 迪拉斯 for reporting )
 - Upgraded dist.ini to Dist::Zilla 2.x

1.10001919 2009-09-12T06:17:57Z
 - Dropped the version dep on FindBin because it causes problems for some.
   Apparently deping on something that may or may not be in core which may
   or may not be in core later is a bad thing.
 - Added CompileTests
 - Add dist.ini to release for diagnostic reasons.

1.10000417 2009-08-28T04:52:32Z
 - Moved the tests around.
 - More tests.
 - All versions now maxing out to encourage upgrading.
 - Moved to relative dating scheme
 - Tighter DogFeed Loopback in buildsystem.
 - Critic'd.
 - Documentation Upped on the plugs.

1.0920022 2009-07-19T22:52:48Z
 - Moved Documentation to a .pm file to satisfy Module::Build

1.0920015 2009-07-19T15:31:07Z
 - Now eating own dog food.
 - Scan *.pm|*.pod so that .pod files index properly
 - Only scan lib/
 - Fixed Bug with META's having ; in them.

1.0920012 2009-07-19T12:24:43Z
 - First version.
