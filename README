OPTIONS INHERITED FROM Dist::Zilla::Role::MetaProvider::Provider
  "inherit_version"
    How do you want existing versions ( Versions hard-coded into files
    before running this plug-in )to be processed?

    *   DEFAULT: inherit_version = 1

        Ignore anything you find in a file, and just probe "DZIL->version()"
        for a value. This is a sane default and most will want this.

    *   inherit_version = 0

        Use this option if you actually want to use hard-coded values in
        your files and use the versions parsed out of them.

  "inherit_missing"
    In the event you are using the aforementioned ""inherit_version" = 0",
    this determines how to behave when encountering a module with no version
    defined.

    *   DEFAULT: inherit_missing = 1

        When a module has no version, probe "DZIL->version()" for an answer.
        This is what you want if you want to have some files with fixed
        versions, and others to just automatically be maintained by
        Dist::Zilla.

    *   inherit_missing = 0

        When a module has no version, emit a versionless record in the final
        metadata.

  "meta_noindex"
    This is a utility for people who are also using "MetaNoIndex", so that
    its settings can be used to eliminate items from the 'provides' list.

    *   meta_noindex = 0

        By default, do nothing unusual.

    *   DEFAULT: meta_noindex = 1

        When a module meets the criteria provided to "MetaNoIndex",
        eliminate it from the metadata shipped to Dist::Zilla
